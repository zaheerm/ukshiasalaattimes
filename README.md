UK Shia Salaat Times
====================


[Android application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azam.android.salaattimes) allowing you to find out easily what time salaat (prayer) is for Shia muslims following the KSIMC of London timetable, KSIMC of Birmingham timetable, Husaini Islamic Centre in Peterborough or Masjid al Husayn in Leicester.


If desired, a notification is sent at prayer time to remind you of prayer time. In addition there is a widget showing the next prayer and when it is.


A new feature added recently allows you to choose calculated times from your GPS location rather than using the above mentioned timetables. The calculation algorithm uses the Jafari method.
